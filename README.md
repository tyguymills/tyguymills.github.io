This is the first time I wrote a html and css document that's linked to each other. Most of the time for work, I had to use Wordpress which does the heavy lifting for you so you only need a minimal amount of code. This was very interesting and difficult at times, however I think I pulled through.


P.S. I recently had problems with the css not loading. For some reason the style isn't hooked up which is wrong. The title and h1 tags should be blue.
